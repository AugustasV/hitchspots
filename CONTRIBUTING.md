# How to contribute to hitchspots

That's great that you want to contribute! Here is a few things you can do

## Report a bug or suggest a feature

You can use Github issues for that, please be as clear as possible. If necessary, please add images, error traces, code samples, etc.

## Write some code

It can be either fixing an issue you found yourself, fixing one of the Github issues, or submitting a new feature. Please open a PR for any changes.

Please follow the Rubocop rules (or suggest a change if appropriate), write unit tests for your changes, and update the documentation.
